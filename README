This is the first open-source project being put out by us. It's based on our article: "Writing a simple blog with Zend Framework and mongoDB" that you can find at: http://www.maltblue.com/2010/11/software-development/php/frameworks/zend-framework/writing-a-simple-blog-with-zend-framework-and-mongodb.

It's going to be developing a blog application based around that article and the follow-up articles that are planned. If you'd like to contribute, please get in touch with us via email at development@maltblue.com
